# CartMates â€“ Collaborative Shopping Cart Platform

A collaborative e-commerce cart system enabling users to manage a shared shopping cart, provide real-time feedback, and receive AI-powered purchase recommendations.

- **Frontend**: Built using a modified Bootstrap template for a responsive UI.
- **Backend**: Python Flask API using Hugging Face Transformers (sentiment analysis) and OpenAI Whisper (voice transcription, adapted and modified).
- **Realtime Features**: Firebase for synchronization and cloud storage.

---

## Features

### ðŸ›’ Smart Cart System
- Real-time product management (add, remove, update)
- Automatic total calculation (tax and shipping)

### ðŸ‘¥ Collaborator Features
- Multi-modal reactions: Emoji, text, and voice messages
- Instant real-time sync between user and collaborator views
- Voice message recording and playback (Web API)

### ðŸ¤– AI & Voice Integration
- **AI suggestions:** Sentiment analysis on collaborator feedback using pre-trained Hugging Face models
- **Voice-to-text:** Uses [OpenAI Whisper](https://github.com/openai/whisper) (reference implementation, modified for this project)
- Sentiment and emoji-based "Buy" or "Skip" recommendations with confidence scoring

### ðŸ”¥ Firebase Integration
- Realtime Firestore database for reactions and cart data

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/gkismat/CartMates.git
cd CartMates
````

### 2. Firebase Setup

* Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
* Create a new project, enable Firestore Database and Storage
* Update `collaborator/firebase-config.js` with your Firebase credentials

**Example:**

```js
const firebaseConfig = {
  apiKey: "your-api-key",
  authDomain: "your-project.firebaseapp.com",
  projectId: "your-project-id",
  storageBucket: "your-project.appspot.com",
  messagingSenderId: "your-sender-id",
  appId: "your-app-id"
};
```

* Set Firestore and Storage rules as needed (for demo: `allow read, write: if true`)

### 3. Backend (Flask) Setup

```bash
# Create and activate a virtual environment (Mac/Linux)
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

# On Windows:
# python -m venv venv
# venv\Scripts\activate

# Install Python dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the backend
python app.py
```

* The backend runs at `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`

### 4. Frontend Setup

```bash
cd FashionStore-pro
python3 -m http.server 8000
```

* Open `http://localhost:8000/products.html` for the main store, or other HTML files as needed.

---

## Usage Flow

1. **Add Products:** Browse and add products via `products.html`.
2. **View Cart:** See your selections in `cart.html`.
3. **Collaborator Feedback:** Open `collaborator/collaborator_card.html` on another device/window, provide feedback using text, emoji, or voice.
4. **AI Suggestions:** Receive instant "Buy" or "Skip" popups based on reactions.

---

## Technical Implementation

### Data Flow

* Products â†’ Added to cart â†’ Stored in localStorage + Firebase
* Collaborator â†’ Reacts to products â†’ Reactions stored in Firebase
* AI System â†’ Analyzes reactions â†’ Generates suggestions
* User â†’ Receives suggestions â†’ Makes informed decisions

### Real-time Sync

* **Firebase Firestore:** Real-time database updates for cart and reactions
* **Storage:** Firebase Storage for audio files
* **Web APIs:** For voice recording/playback

### AI Suggestion Algorithm

* **Model:** Pre-trained Hugging Face Transformers for sentiment analysis (inference only)
* **Voice:** [OpenAI Whisper](https://github.com/openai/whisper) used for speech-to-text (reference code, adapted for project)
* **Recommendation Logic:** Positive sentiment + positive emojis â†’ "Buy"; negative â†’ "Skip"

> **Note:**
>
> * FashionStore Template and Bootstrap are used as a base and **heavily modified** for this project.
> * OpenAI Whisper was used as a reference and integrated/modified for voice transcription.
> * Hugging Face Transformers models are used **for inference only** (not retrained).

## Troubleshooting

* **Voice recording not working:** Check browser microphone permissions.
* **Reactions not syncing:** Verify Firebase configuration.
* **Cart not updating:** Check localStorage and browser console for errors.
* **AI suggestions not showing:** Ensure Flask backend is running and dependencies are installed.

---

## Future Enhancements
